                     <p>
                        The Communication Collective, formerly known as PURE,
                        boasts a current brand identity crafted by Vlada
                        Barsanova for her GRD202 graphic design class. Founded
                        in 2018, the organization's primary mission is to
                        enhance networking among students and nurture closer
                        connections amongst peers. This initiative was driven by
                        the ambition to create a vibrant platform for student
                        interaction.
